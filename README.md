# Installation

## Download prepared release (recommended)

Download and run the file suitable for your OS [from latest release](https://github.com/Seeroy/kubek-minecraft-dashboard/releases/latest)

## Build from sources

Clone repository and install libs
**Node.js >= 20 required!**
```
git clone https://github.com/Seeroy/kubek-minecraft-dashboard.git
cd kubek-minecraft-dashboard
npm install
```

Start after installation
```
npm start
```

## Use Docker container

If you know all the ports you need to use, you can run Kubek in Docker using a command like this. In this example, port 3000 is used for the panel itself, and 25565 for the server
Replace YOUR_DIRECTORY with your folder path

```
docker run -d --name kubek \
            --restart unless-stopped \
			-p 3000:3000 \
			-p 25565:25565 \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/servers:/usr/kubek/servers \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/logs:/usr/kubek/logs \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/binaries:/usr/kubek/binaries \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/config.json:/usr/kubek/config.json \
			seeroy/kubek-minecraft-dashboard
```

If you want to open all ports, then use the command below (with it, Kubek will always work on port 3000, port remapping is not available)
```
docker run -d --name kubek --network host \
            --restart unless-stopped \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/servers:/usr/kubek/servers \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/logs:/usr/kubek/logs \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/binaries:/usr/kubek/binaries \
			-v /YOUR_DIRECTORY/config.json:/usr/kubek/config.json \
			seeroy/kubek-minecraft-dashboard
```
